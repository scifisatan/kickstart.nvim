I just deleted the entire readme file by pressing 3 keystrokes and i feel like a god fr

`vGd`
- v -> to enter visual mode
- G -> to select till the end of file
- d -> to delete the selected content

After that, 
- i -> to enter the insert mode

And lastly,
- :wq -> to write and quit the file then i'll git push

`:Tutor` is very helpful and im mad at myself why i didn't go through it before.
better late than never ig

For future me, if i want to reinstall nvim and apply the config run this
```
git clone https://github.com/scifisatan/kickstart.nvim.git $env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\nvim\
```
